        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The history of people in Yosemite goes back thousands of years. American Indians traveled and used this area since Ice Age glaciers receded providing an environment for plants, animals, and people to survive. Their descendents remain a part of Yosemite’s history to the present day.</p>
        <p>In 1849, the discovery of gold in California meant new groups of people arriving in California. Competition for land and resources brought many of these groups into conflict, and, often, into violent confrontations. The first non-native group to enter Yosemite was the Mariposa Battalion, a Euro-American militia formed to drive the native Ahwahneechee people onto reservations. After the Mariposa Indian War came to a close, Yosemite was now open to settlement and speculation.</p>
        <p>Through the work of illustrators, authors, painters, and photographers, word spread of the magnificent valley in the heart of the Sierra Nevada and giant trees. Many pioneers became tourist operators, building hotels and inns and starting stagecoach companies to bring the interested early tourists on the long journey to Yosemite. By 1864, the value of Yosemite was recognized by the federal government when Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant, placing Yosemite under the protection of the state of California.</p>
        <p>The growth of the national park and the surrounding areas has seen a large cast of characters. Some are famous worldwide, like John Muir and Ansel Adams, while others are significant at a smaller scale.</p>
        <p>Individual and group contributions to Yosemite abound and help shape how we learn about and experience the park today.</p>

                <p>This is a brief introduction to the Southern Sierra Miwok life, history, and language, providing further information about the Indian Village of Ahwahnee, located behind the Yosemite Museum in Yosemite Valley.</p>
                <p>This reconstructed village is located on the former site of the largest Indian village in Yosemite Valley. The bark houses, ceremonial roundhouse, sweathouse, pounding rocks, cabin, acorn granaries, and chief's house are representative of the structures found in a Sierra Nevada Miwok village of the late nineteenth century. Today the village is still actively used by members of the local American Indian community for ceremonies and special gatherings.</p>
                <p>The word "Miwok" is also spelled "Miwuk" or "Me-Wuk." Translated as "people" or "Indian people," it is used to identify persons who are descended from any one of the several different Miwok groups in California.</p>

                <p>Several hundred giant sequoia trees surrounded Galen Clark in a majestic 1857 setting that inspired him to write newspaper articles about this must-see spot located six miles southeast of present-day Wawona. Though not the first to see the Mariposa Grove, he is believed to be the first known to count and measure the trees. This humble carpenter would eventually spend the remaining 50 years of his life publicizing and protecting the Big Trees and Yosemite—seeing it both as a state grant and a national park.</p>
